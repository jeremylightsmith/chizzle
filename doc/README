=Chizzle is a Ruby-Cocoa based IDE for Ruby

It wants to grow up to be a slimmed down version of what intellij is for java.

Pro Tips :

=Debugging 
  - use Console.app 
    - if it is open when you launch your app, then it will get anything that would otherwise go to the console (nice to know)
  - open CrashReporterPrefs, and set mode to "Developer"
    - this gives you actual stack traces when everything crashes
